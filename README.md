# Coles-Proxy

My System Design Capstone project for HRLA22. This is the proxy server which is meant to hit the NGINX load balancer which will redircect to an instance of my micro-service. This micro-service uses a PostgreSQL Database which has been optimized for heavy traffic.

My micro-service:

The micro-service I chose was designed by another student during our Front End Capstone project phase where we each designed a functional front end component which would render data correctly.
